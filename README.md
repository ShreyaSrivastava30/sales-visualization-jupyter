Conclusion
•	The dataset shows expected positive relationships between units and sales within each year.
•	Cross-year relationships are less stable, indicating shifts in market/product behaviour.
•	The data contains quality issues (negative sales) and outliers, which must be addressed.
•	Overall, the analysis gives useful insights into year-wise sales performance and variability, but requires cleaning and further exploration for actionable business decisions.
